# IntelliPipe

**Open Source Data Pipeline Platform for Modern Security and Observability**

---

## 🚀 Vision

IntelliPipe is an open source alternative to commercial data pipeline solutions, purpose-built for observability, SIEM, and XDR use cases. We're creating a platform that empowers security and operations teams to build flexible, transparent, and cost-effective data processing pipelines without vendor lock-in.

## 🎯 Mission

Transform how organizations handle security and observability data by providing:

- **Open & Flexible Pipelines** - Build custom data flows that adapt to your environment
- **Built-in Observability** - Monitor your monitoring tools with comprehensive telemetry
- **Dynamic Routing & Filtering** - Intelligent data processing at the edge using open standards
- **Community-Driven Development** - Transparent, collaborative, and vendor-neutral

## 🔍 The Problem We're Solving

Modern security and observability teams face:

- **Vendor Lock-in** - Proprietary solutions that limit flexibility and increase costs
- **Data Silos** - Fragmented toolchains that don't communicate effectively  
- **Scaling Challenges** - Expensive commercial solutions that don't scale with growing data volumes
- **Limited Transparency** - Black-box processing that makes troubleshooting difficult
- **Integration Complexity** - Difficulty adapting to diverse, evolving technology stacks

## 🏗️ Our Approach

IntelliPipe leverages open standards and community-driven development to deliver:

### Core Principles
- **Open Standards First** - Built on widely-adopted protocols and formats
- **Edge-Native Processing** - Intelligent filtering and routing at collection points
- **Observability by Design** - Full visibility into pipeline performance and data flow
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** - Scalable, containerized, and deployment-flexible
- **Security-Focused** - Purpose-built for SIEM, XDR, and threat detection workflows

### Key Capabilities (Planned)
- Real-time data transformation and enrichment
- Dynamic routing based on content, metadata, and business logic
- Built-in data quality monitoring and alerting
- Extensible plugin architecture
- Multi-destination output with format adaptation
- Comprehensive API for automation and integration
